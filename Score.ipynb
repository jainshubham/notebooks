So, what is happening is that equity market liquidity has dried up and no investors want to come in and invest,\" Chauhan told PTI in an interview.</p><p>\"Also, the maximum STT is for delivery-based transactions that are investment transactions and there is less STT for intra-day transactions which is not delivery based. The STT is even lesser for futures.</p><p>\"So, effectively, we are penalising in our STT structure the investment activity.

The BSE has to exist for the nation and it can not be thinking for itself alone.

In the last 20 years, the <span style=\"border-bottom: medium double #D38833\">India</span>n middle class has grown ten times, but the number of investors has remained similar. In some sense, we can say that the BSE and other participants have not been able to do enough to bring people to the markets,\" he added.</p><p>Chauhan said the Sensex has given a return of about 300 times in the last 35 years, but not all in the country have benefited from this rally.</p><p>\"Basically, we need to educate investors. Now is the time for the BSE to stand up and be counted. When the nation is on a path to growth, the BSE also has to move hand in hand and to ensure that the capital requirement of the economy is made available to them,\" he added.</p><p>The BSE CEO said the equity IPO market has not been good for last few years, except for SME platforms, in terms of raising funds.</p><p>\"What <span style=\"border-bottom: medium double #D38833\">India</span> needs to do is focus on moving people away from gold, silver and real estate that are not productive assets and shift the savings towards financial instruments.</p><p>\"These can be be bank deposits, mutual funds or directly into stock markets, where investments can be used for providing funds to the infrastructure, manufacturing, services and defence sectors.</p><p>\"These sectors basically create jobs and the government would not be able to create jobs directly. <span style=\"border-bottom: medium double #D38833\">India</span> needs to create 1.5 crore new jobs every year for the next 20 years. So, when a person invests in financial instruments, he not only gets the return but also participates in the nation building,\" he added.</p><p>Chauhan said that funds can be generated if the large population of <span style=\"border-bottom: medium double #D38833\">India</span>, which saves a lot, is convinced about putting their savings into financial instruments.</p><p>\"Today, the way automation has progressed and the increased penetration of mobile trading, Internet etc would make things easier. So, <span style=\"border-bottom: medium double #D38833\">India</span>n markets are poised to support the government.</p><p>\"There also needs to be policies that are amenable to investments and not promote trading just for the sake of trading. Today, the stock market has somehow become focussed more on trading, rather than investment activities.</p><p>\"So, they need to move away from trading-focussed business and focus on investments to help the country build the manufacturing sector by raising funds for new and existing companies.
